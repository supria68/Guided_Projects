## A Visual History of Nobel Prize Winners

### Project Description:
The Nobel Prize is perhaps the world's most well known scientific award. Every year it is given to scientists and scholars in chemistry, literature, physics, medicine, economics, and peace. The first Nobel Prize was handed out in 1901, and at that time the prize was Eurocentric and male-focused, but nowadays it's not biased in any way. 

This project aims at using the data manipulation and visualization skills to explore patterns and trends over 100 years worth of Nobel Prize winners. The dataset used in this project is from The Nobel Foundation on Kaggle.
