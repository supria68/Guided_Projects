## ASL Recognition with Deep Learning

### Project Description:
American Sign Language (ASL) is the primary language used by many deaf individuals in North America, and it is also used by hard-of-hearing and hearing individuals. The language is as rich as spoken languages and employs signs made with the hand, along with facial gestures and bodily postures.  

This project aims at building a convolutional neural network to classify images of letters from American Sign Language.

### Tasks:
1. American Sign Language (ASL)
2. Visualize the training data
3. Examine the dataset
4. One-hot encode the data
5. Define the model
6. Compile the model
7. Train the model
8. Test the model
9. Visualize mistakes
